This project is task 1 of the assignments to be completed as a part of the selection procedure for the web development internship under Oyster Training.

This project serves as demonstration of various technologies provided by node.js, React.js and redux. It has been made using the React.js framework, provided by Facebook and state management is achieved using redux and occasionally react hooks.

The source code is divided into various segments for better organization and readability and to enhance the scope of future scalability.

The src folder is divided into actions, reducers, Components and shared folders along with other essential files.

It was an amazing project which I enjoyed a lot and at the same time overcame certain unforeseen obstacles. Overall, it served as a great learning experience.
